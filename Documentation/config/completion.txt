completion.commands::
	This is only used by git-completion.bash to add or remove
	commands from the list of completed commands. Normally only
	porcelain commands and a few select others are completed. You
	can add more commands, separated by space, in this
	variable. Prefixing the command with '-' will remove it from
	the existing list.

completion.commitMessageCallback::
    This is only used by git-completion.bash for declaring an executable
    or a shell function which will be used when user types
    `git commit --message=` and then presses completion key (TAB).
    The callback must return one string for commit message.
    This can be used when all commit messages must have, for example,
    same prefix, e.g. a work order number.
    Instead of this configuration variable, environment variable
    GIT_COMPLETION_COMMIT_MESSAGE_CALLBACK can be used.
    Environment variable overrides the configuration variable.
